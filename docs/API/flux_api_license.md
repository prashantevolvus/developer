  <h2>FluxPay API License Agreement</h2>

  <p>
    <b>1. API and Content Description.</b> Licensee desires to license certain of Fluxpay’s (“Flux”) application programming interfaces and their associated tools and documentation, (“APIs”), that are designed to permit Licensee to receive data and
    content (“Content”) from Flux’s proprietary database so that Licensee can create an application or service or enhance an existing application or service (Licensee’s “Application”).
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>2. API and Content License. </b> Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Flux grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-assignable license under Flux’s intellectual property rights during
    the
    term of this Agreement (a) to use the APIs to develop, test, and support the Application; (b) to distribute or allow access to Licensee’s integration of the APIs within the Application to end users of the Application; and (c) to display the
    Content received from the APIs within the Application. Licensee has no right to distribute or allow access to the stand-alone APIs.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>3. Developer Documentation.</b> Licensee’s use of the APIs and display of the Content must comply with the technical documentation, usage guidelines call volume limits, and other documentation (“Developer Documentation”) maintained at Flux’s
    developer site. Flux may consent in writing (email acceptable) to increase the call volume limits, in which case such increased limits shall apply unless and until Flux revokes such consent (email acceptable). In the event of any conflict
    between the Developer Documentation and this Agreement, this Agreement shall control.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>4. Restrictions. </b> Except as expressly and unambiguously authorized under this Agreement or by Flux in writing, Licensee shall not (i) Disclose or provide the APIs to any person or entity other than to Licensee’s employees or independent
    contractors who are individuals, provided (a) such independent contractors enter into an agreement with Licensee at least as protective of Flux’s rights as this Agreement, and (b) Licensee hereby agree to be responsible for, and liable
    to Flux for, any breaches of such agreements by Licensee’s independent contractors, (ii) use the APIs for any illegal, unauthorized or otherwise improper purposes, or in any manner which would violate this Agreement or the Developer
    Documentation, or breach any laws or regulations, or violate the rights of third parties; (iii) remove any legal, copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notices contained in or on materials Licensee receive or access pursuant
    to this Agreement, including but not limited to, the APIs, the Developer Documentation, and the Content; (iv) charge, directly or indirectly, any incremental fees (including any unique, specific, or premium charges) for access to the
    Content or Licensee’s integration of the APIs in the Application; (v) advertise the product or services of Flux’s competitors in the Application; (vi) sell, lease, share, transfer, sublicense or fail to protect the confidentiality of
    any Content obtained through the APIs, directly or indirectly, to any third party, including any data broker, ad network, ad exchange, or other advertising monetization-related party; (vii) use the APIs in a manner that, as determined
    by Flux in its sole discretion, exceeds reasonable request volume, constitutes excessive or abusive usage, or otherwise fails to comply or is inconsistent with any part of the Developer Documentation; (viii) use the APIs in an
    Application that competes with products or services offered by Flux; (ix) use the APIs in conjunction with, or combine content from the APIs with, Flux content obtained through scraping or any other means outside the official Flux APIs;
    (x) interfere with or disrupt Flux services or servers or networks connected to Flux services, or disobey any requirements, procedures, policies or regulations of networks connected to Flux services, or transmit any viruses, worms,
    defects, Trojan horses, or any items of a destructive nature through your use of the APIs; or (xi) copy adapt, reformat, reverse-engineer, disassemble, decompile, download, translate or otherwise modify the APIs, Content, Flux’s website
    other content or services, or any of our other services, through automated or other means. This Agreement does not include any right for Licensee to use any trademark, service mark, trade name or any other mark of Flux or any other
    party or licensor. No rights or licenses are granted except as expressly and unambiguously set forth herein. If Licensee violates any of the foregoing restrictions, Flux shall own all right, title and interest relating to any and all
    inventions, works of authorship, designs, know-how, ideas and information made or conceived or reduced to practice, in while or in part, using the API. Licensee hereby agrees to make all assignments necessary to accomplish the foregoing
    ownership.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>5. Proprietary Rights. </b> As between the parties, Flux owns all rights, title, and interest in and to the APIs and to all output and executables of the APIs, and, subject to the foregoing, Licensee owns all rights, title, and interest
    in and to the Application. Except to the limited extent expressly provided in this Agreement, neither party grants, and the other party shall not acquire, any right, title or interest (including, without limitation, any implied
    license) in or to any property of the first party. All rights not expressly granted herein are deemed withheld.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>6. User Agreements.</b> You shall enter into a valid and binding end user license agreement with all users of your Application (the “EULA”) that contain provisions that contain all of the restrictions on the use of the Content as
    those contained in this Agreement. Additionally such EULA shall contain limitations of liability and warranty disclaimers with respect to the Content consistent with the limitations contained herein.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>7. Fees. </b>Licensee shall pay the fees set forth in the service and/or order form or Partnership agreement, or if no such form or agreement is entered into, Licensee shall access Flux’s public APIs at no charge. All fees shall
    be non-refundable, and payable in US dollars or the Local Currency on the date they come due. Fees will be payable in the manner specified by Flux. If based on Flux invoices, such fees shall be payable within fifteen (15) days from the date on
    the applicable invoice. Licensee shall also pay all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, tariffs and duties of any type assessed against Flux except for taxes on Flux’s income. Flux may disable API or Platform access in
    the event of a failure to pay.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      8. Support. </b>Licensee agrees to report to Flux any errors or difficulties discovered and the characteristic conditions and symptoms of such errors and difficulties. Flux is in no way obligated to provide Licensee with any

  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      9. Interoperability. </b>Licensee shall endeavor to inform Flux with respect to the interoperability and compatibility of Licensee’s products with Flux’s management systems as contemplated herein, and any issues or problems with

  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      10. Confidentiality. </b>The API (including, without limitation, all improvement, derivatives, modifications and the like) constitutes Flux’s confidential information (“Confidential Information”). Licensee hereby agrees (i) to

    confidential materials), (ii) not to divulge any Confidential Information to any third person (except consultants, subject to the conditions stated below), (iii) not to use any Confidential Information except for the
    purposes set forth in this Agreement, and (iv) not to copy or reverse engineer any Confidential Information. Any employee or consultant given access to the Confidential Information must have a legitimate “need to know” and
    shall be similarly bound in writing. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique nature of the Flux’s Confidential Information, there can be no adequate remedy at law for any breach of its obligations hereunder
    and therefore, that upon any such breach or any threat thereof, Flux shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever remedies it might have at law.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      11. Indemnity. </b>Licensee agrees that Flux shall have no liability whatsoever for (i) any use Licensee makes of the API or (ii) Licensee’s Application. Licensee shall indemnify and hold harmless Flux from any and all claims,
    damages, liabilities, costs and fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from (i) or (ii).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      12. Warranty Disclaimer. </b>The parties acknowledge that the API, Content and any services are provided “AS IS.” EXCEPT FOR BODILY INJURY, COMPANY AND ITS LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES RELATING TO THE API OR ANY SERVICES,

    survive termination of this Agreement.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      15. Government Use. </b>If Licensee is part of an agency, department, or other entity of the United States Government ("Government"), the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure or transfer of the API
